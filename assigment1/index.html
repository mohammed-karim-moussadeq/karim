            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somehwere in the realm of science and technology. 
                You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted ze were most intrigued 
                by are as follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resverattol (C14H12O3).</li>
                <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures</li>
                <li> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think 
                we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dance are as follows, with definitions: <br></p>
                    
                </div>
            
                <ol>polynesian chickens dance</ol>
                <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their lifestock 
                    to be "fruitful".
                </p>
        
            
                <ol>Icelandic brownian shuffle </ol>
            <p>
                before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around 
                in imperceptibilty tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he tought this dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.
            </p>
            <ol>Arctic robot dance. </ol>
            <p> 
                An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced 
                by inhabitants
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
